/**
 * Redux Store Configuration
 *
 * This file configures the global Redux store with persistence support.
 * It integrates:
 * - Redux Toolkit for simplified store setup
 * - Redux Persist for persisting and rehydrating state from localStorage
 * - Multiple slice reducers
 *
 * The store is designed to ensure authentication state is preserved
 * across sessions, while other slices remain non-persistent for performance
 * and data freshness.
